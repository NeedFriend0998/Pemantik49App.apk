This application was created by a student from the Pemantik members at Smpn 49 Surabaya school.
This application is useful for other students who are often bullied, because in this application there is a a form that can be sent to the BK (guidance and counseling) teacher or to other members of the school to resolve the bullying problem at school. And also this application is useful for the trigger website because our website does not have a domain so people who want to report bullying problems are confused because they might forget the website address.

To download our application you can click the "release" button or the "tag" button then select the latest version.
